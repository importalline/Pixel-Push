🎨 Pixel Push

A Git commit simulator for students, learners, and curious developers.
Pixel Push helps you understand how Git works under the hood by generating realistic commit activity across a custom timeline — perfect for visualizing contribution graphs, practicing version control, and building your Git confidence.

📚 What Is Pixel Push?

Pixel Push is a Node.js-based tool that automates Git commits with randomized dates, messages, and file targets. It simulates natural development activity over time, making it ideal for:
- 🧠 Learning Git and version control
- 📈 Enhancing your GitHub contribution graph
- 🧪 Testing commit automation and scripting
- 🎓 Building a portfolio as a Computer Science student

🛠️ How It Works

Pixel Push generates commits between January 2024 and October 2025, with 13–15 commits per month. Each commit includes:
- A realistic timestamp using --date
- A randomly selected file (e.g., main.py, index.html, notes.txt)
- A natural commit message (e.g., Fix layout issue, Add login feature)
- A push to your Git repository
This creates a believable and educational commit history that mirrors real development work.

🧪 Why Use Pixel Push?

Whether you're a student, a beginner, or just curious about Git internals, Pixel Push helps you:
- Understand how Git timestamps affect contribution graphs
- Practice scripting with Git and Node.js
- Explore commit automation and file tracking
- Build a visually active GitHub profile with meaningful commit messages
